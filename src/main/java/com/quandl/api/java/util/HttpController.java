/**
 * Class to centralize HTTP requests, specifically to enable easy mocking of HTTP requests.
 * 
 * Currently this is an implementation detail - i.e. users of the library shouldn't need to
 * see or use this class.  However since it wraps HttpClient callers could have a problem
 * with it making un-managed HTTP requests.  Ideally, QuandlConnection should let users
 * pass in their own HttpController, or perhaps even better, we should mock HttpClient
 * or HttpGet directly, rather than use this wrapper.  As a first pass, this is good enough.
